Project title:
Car Inspector

Project Idea:
Car Inspector aims to provide all available records of cars to be checked by buyers and resellers to help them get the required information easily and accurately, with the bonus of also using AI to predict the approximate price of the car based on the available information.

Primary Goals:
1- Allow the potential buyer to enter the car's vin and plate number to show all available records on the car providing the customer with reliable information.
2- Implement an AI system that based on the available damage info and unpaid fines gives an approximate price for the car.
