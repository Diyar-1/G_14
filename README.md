Title:   
Car Inspector
Abstract: 
Car Inspector aims to provide all available records of cars to be checked by buyers and resellers to help them get the required information easily and accurately.
Goal:
The goal of this project is to allow potential car buyers to enter the car's VIN and plate number to check the history of the car for any past damages and unpaid traffic fines, allowing the buyer to make confident decisions about the car.
Current Practice:
The current practice for checking a car's history is unreliable and susceptible to scams because it mostly depends on the seller's honesty and even if taken for a checkup, current methods don't show every type of damage sustained reliably.
Novelty:
An app to view a car’s complete history and to dynamically estimate the price according to its condition.

Effects:
It will give customers vital information about a car that they are planning to buy and can help build trust between the buyer and seller.
Technical Approach:
The system requires access to records that are available in traffic police stations and each vehicle’s VIN number, license plate number, detailed information about the repair locations and processes performed on the vehicles.  The system will include an algorithm that compares the car’s current market price with other cars which are available on the market to provide accurate value estimations. The system will display key information about the car by using secured storage and servers connected to official vehicle databases.

Risks:
One of the problems developers might face while doing this project is reaching car information from Traffic police station due to legal restrictions. The system needs a strong storing method, because protecting the user’s privacy is a priority. This system must be updated regularly in order to stay accurate and reliable. Lastly servers need to be optimized properly to prevent slowing system and overloading
