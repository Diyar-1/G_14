Validation and Quality assurance

Risks:

•	Traffic Police Records retrieval: These Records contain sensitive information, and it could present a risk of tracking cars using these records therefore precautions will be made to ensure confidentiality and only needed data to be shown to the user without going into details.
•	User added Maintenance Records: These Records might be subject to false information added by the user, to prevent this a receipt containing matched maintenance data should be included.
•	Integration: Getting all of the features to work together could present a challenge, and to overcome that, robust software engineering techniques must be used.
